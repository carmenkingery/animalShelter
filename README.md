How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

    One of the best ways to write a maintainable program is to keep 
    it modular. Don't put everything in one file. Instead separate them 
    into many files, or modules. How I accomplished this in my project here 
    is by first writing a python file with my CRUD methods for accessesing
    and manipulating the database. Then I wrote the UI portion of the project
    in a separate ipynb file. This keeps your code cleaner and easier to
    read. It also provides an excellent way to reuse your code for more projects.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

    The valuable strategy I learned while working on this project is being open.
    There were many times I found myself completely stuck and I'd try to convince 
    myself that if I just kept pushing I would figure out the solution. However 
    all I needed to do was reach out and have fresh eyes look at the problem. 
    Coding is always a team effort. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
